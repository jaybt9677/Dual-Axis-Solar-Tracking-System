## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components Used
| Component | Quantity | Function |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| Arduino Nano | 1 | Controls the system |
| LDR Sensors | 4 | Detect sunlight intensity |
| Servo Motors | 2 | Rotate the panels on two axes |

## üß† Working Principle

1. **LDR sensors** detect sunlight intensity from different directions.  
2. The **Arduino Nano** compares the sensor readings and adjusts the **servo motors** accordingly.  
3. The **solar panel assembly** moves both horizontally and vertically to align perpendicular to the sunlight.  
4. The system maximizes energy generation throughout the day and closes the panels during low light.

## üíª Coding Section

All source codes are stored inside the [`Codes/`](Codes/) folder.  
Below is a description of each subfolder:

| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| [`Main/`](Codes/Main/) | Contains the **main Arduino code** (`Dual_Axis_Solar_Tracker.ino`) that runs the complete dual-axis solar tracking system. |
| [`Test_LDR_Sensors/`](Codes/Test_LDR_Sensors/) | Code to individually **test all LDR sensors** and verify light intensity readings in the Serial Monitor. |
| [`Test_Servo_Motors/`](Codes/Test_Servo_Motors/) | Code to **test both servo motors** by sweeping them across full motion range. |
| [`Test_Combined_Sensors/`](Codes/Test_Combined_Sensors/) | Combines all LDR readings to display **top-bottom** and **left-right** intensity differences before full integration. |

### üßæ Example Arduino Snippet

```cpp
int ldrTopLeft = A0;
int ldrTopRight = A1;
int ldrBottomLeft = A2;
int ldrBottomRight = A3;

// Code logic compares LDR readings and moves servo motors
